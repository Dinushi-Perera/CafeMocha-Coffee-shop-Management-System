Café Mocha, a popular coffee shop frequented by thousands of customers each month, currently relies on a manual system for managing orders, billing, and record-keeping, which has proven inefficient and error-prone. This project seeks to develop a computerized system that automates these operations, enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and overall customer satisfaction. The system aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing customer orders, billing, and records, with features including a secure login system, menu item management, accurate bill generation with taxes and discounts, and a help feature for user guidance. The scope includes a console-based Java application with data stored in text files, addressing the inefficiencies of the manual system and improving service speed and reliability. It assumes users are familiar with basic computer operations, the system will be used in a single location, and all transactions are processed in real-time.
